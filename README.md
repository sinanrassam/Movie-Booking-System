# Movie Booking System Implementation
This was an assignment for the paper programming 2 at Auckland University of Technology.

The goal of this assignment is to create a movie booking system that allows a teller to book Adult, elderly or Child tickets to different movies using a nicely presented front end GUI. It should keep track of different movies being played, which seats have already been booked and not allow child tickets to be purchased for R rated movies or ensure that a child has to be accompanied by an adult for M rated movies.
